# MNIST Digit Recognizer
This is a project for practice in machine learning when I took [CS5785](https://cornelltech.github.io/cs5785-fall-2017/) in Cornell Tech.
In this project, I participated in Kaggle [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) Contest. <br>

You can find a report [here](https://github.com/baihuajun24/MNIST/blob/master/cs5785.pdf) exlaining what features I found in the data and
how I chose k nearest neighbor as my classifier to solve the problem. After cross-validation, I decided to use k=1 classifier to submit and achieved
0.97144 accuracy.
